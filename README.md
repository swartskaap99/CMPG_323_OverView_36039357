Developer branch. This branch will be utilized the most out of them all. Here we will do most of our work and coding.

## gitignore file.
It is a file that contains all the files and/or file types that we dont want git to track. In the case of Project 1, We are not tracking backup files or temporary files.

## Credential and Sensitive information.
Do not store passwords to anything in git hub. However to assist with the managing of git hub credentials, I would utilise git credential manager.

Encrypted secrets allow you to store sensitive information in your organization, repository, or repository environments. (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)
